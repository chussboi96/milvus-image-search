# Milvus Image Search
A Python-based implementation of an advanced image search system utilizing Milvus vector database and image embeddings from ResNet.


## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of an image search system using Milvus, a highly efficient vector database, combined with deep learning embeddings generated by a pre-trained ResNet model. The system converts images into high-dimensional vectors and uses these for fast and accurate image retrieval.

## Features
- Utilizes ResNet for generating robust image embeddings.
- Employs Milvus for efficient storage and retrieval of high-dimensional image vectors.
- Supports scalable image search with advanced indexing strategies.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch
- timm
- PIL
- pymilvus
